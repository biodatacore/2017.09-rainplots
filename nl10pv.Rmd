Before plotting, we will first transform `p.value` onto the negative log-scale. This allows smaller P-values, which are often of greater interest, to have larger values than P-values that might be of lesser interest.

```{r}
plot_data <- 
  plot_data %>% 
  mutate(p.value = -1 * log10(p.value))
```
